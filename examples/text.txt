When you want to read a book in English, it can be hard to know where to start.
There are millions of books for you to choose from!
Which books should you try reading?

Why not start with the same books native English speakers are reading?
You might think that best sellers (popular books) are too difficult for an English learner to read. But actually, popular books are perfect for learning English, since they’re often written in simple English.
To become really popular, books have to appeal to many people. This means they need to be interesting and easy to understand.
The benefit of reading best sellers is that you’re reading the same books actual English speakers read.
You can learn a lot of vocabulary from them, and more importantly, you can learn more about the culture of native speakers.
You’ll also be able to discuss current books and popular authors with other readers (even native speakers), since best sellers are read by many people.
All of this means that best sellers can teach you a lot, and that you can definitely read them!
